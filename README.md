Project Name: Flood Predictor

Project Description: This project is a Flask application that uses a machine learning model to predict the probability of a flood occurring. The model is trained on a dataset of historical flood data, and can be used to predict the probability of a flood occurring given a set of features, such as rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture.

Installation Instructions:

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:
python Flood_Predictor.py
Usage Instructions:

To predict the probability of a flood occurring, send a POST request to the /Flood-predict endpoint with the following JSON body:
JSON
{
  "feature_vector": [<feature_1>, <feature_2>, ..., <feature_n>]
}

The server will then return a JSON response with the following body:
JSON
{
  "prediction": <flood_probability>
}

You can use this flood probability to determine whether or not a flood is likely to occur.

Features:

The Flood Predictor application supports the following features:
Predict the probability of a flood occurring
Support for multiple feature vectors
JSON response format
